      <h3>1.1 Professional Standards</h3>
      <p>All psychological services provided by Mindful Journey Psychology adhere to the Australian Psychological Society (APS) Code of Ethics and are delivered in accordance with the standards set by the Psychology Board of Australia.</p>
      
      <h3>1.2 Nature of Services</h3>
      <p>Our services include but are not limited to psychological assessment, therapy, counseling, and consultations for individuals across the lifespan, including children (5+ years), adolescents, adults, and families.</p>
      
      <h2>2. Appointments and Fees</h2>
      
      <h3>2.1 Scheduling</h3>

      <h3>2.2 Fee Structure</h3>
      <p>Our current fee schedule is available upon request. Fees are payable at the time of service. We accept payment by EFTPOS, credit card, or direct bank transfer.</p>
      
      <h3>2.3 Medicare and Health Insurance</h3>
      <p>Eligible clients may claim rebates through Medicare with a valid Mental Health Treatment Plan from their GP. We also accept clients with private health insurance that covers psychological services. It is the client's responsibility to confirm their eligibility for rebates.</p>
      
      <h3>2.4 Cancellation Policy</h3>
      <p>We require at least 24 hours notice for cancellation of appointments. Late cancellations (less than 24 hours) or no-shows may incur a fee of 50% of the scheduled appointment cost. Repeated late cancellations or no-shows may result in a requirement for pre-payment for future appointments.</p>
