      <h3>1.2 Nature of Services</h3>
      <p>Our services include but are not limited to psychological assessment, therapy, counseling, and consultations for individuals across the lifespan, including children (5+ years), adolescents, adults, and families.</p>
      
      <h2>2. Appointments and Fees</h2>
      
      <h3>2.1 Scheduling</h3>

      <h3>2.3 Medicare and Health Insurance</h3>
      <p>Eligible clients may claim rebates through Medicare with a valid Mental Health Treatment Plan from their GP. We also accept clients with private health insurance that covers psychological services. It is the client's responsibility to confirm their eligibility for rebates.</p>
      
      <h3>2.4 Cancellation Policy</h3>
      <p>We require at least 24 hours notice for cancellation of appointments. Late cancellations (less than 24 hours) or no-shows may incur a fee of 50% of the scheduled appointment cost. Repeated late cancellations or no-shows may result in a requirement for pre-payment for future appointments.</p>

      <h3>5.2 Limitations</h3>
